# Local Image Storage Implementation for LINKDEV

## Overview
Your LINKDEV project now implements local image storage directly on the hosting server (Render/Vercel) instead of using external services like Cloudinary or AWS S3.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Multer Configuration (`backend/src/utils/multer.ts`)
- **Organized Storage Structure**: Images are stored in specific subdirectories:
  - `/uploads/profile-pictures/` - User profile pictures
  - `/uploads/cover-photos/` - User cover photos  
  - `/uploads/post-images/` - Social media post images
  - `/uploads/resumes/` - User resume documents

- **Automatic Directory Creation**: The system automatically creates these directories if they don't exist

- **File Management Functions**:
  - `getImageUrl()` - Generates full URLs for hosted images
  - `getFilePathFromUrl()` - Extracts file paths from URLs
  - `deleteImageFile()` - Safely deletes old image files

- **File Filtering**: Only allows specific image types (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

### 2. Updated Controllers (`backend/src/controllers/authController.ts`)
- **Enhanced Profile Picture Upload**: Now manages local storage and deletes old images
- **New Cover Photo Upload**: Complete functionality for cover photo management
- **Smart File Management**: Automatically deletes previous images when users upload new ones

### 3. API Routes (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)
- `POST /api/auth/upload-profile-picture` - Upload user profile pictures
- `POST /api/auth/upload-cover-photo` - Upload user cover photos
- Both routes are protected and require authentication

## File Storage Benefits

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for Cloudinary or AWS S3 accounts
- **Cost Effective**: No additional storage costs beyond hosting
- **Simple Integration**: Direct file system access
- **Fast Access**: Images served directly from your domain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
- **Hosting Platform Limits**: 
  - Render.com: Ephemeral file system (files may be lost on restart)
  - Vercel.com: Not ideal for file uploads (read-only file system)
- **Backup Strategy**: Consider implementing a backup solution for important images
- **Storage Limits**: Check your hosting platform's storage limitations

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### For Production Use:
1. **Primary Choice**: Use **Render.com** for the backend with persistent storage
2. **Alternative**: Implement a hybrid approach where images are uploaded locally then backed up to a cloud service
3. **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel.com (optimal for React apps)

### Environment Variables
Both `.env.txt` files are included with all necessary configuration:
- **Backend**: Database connection, JWT secret, file upload settings
- **Frontend**: API endpoint configuration

## Image URLs
When deployed, your images will be accessible at:
```
https://your-backend-domain.com/uploads/profile-pictures/filename.jpg
https://your-backend-domain.com/uploads/cover-photos/filename.jpg
```

## File Upload Limits
- **Max File Size**: 5MB per image
- **Allowed Formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old images are deleted when new ones are uploaded

## Testing Locally
1. Start the backend server
2. Images will be stored in `backend/uploads/` directory
3. Access images via `http://localhost:3001/uploads/...`

Your LINKDEV project is now ready for deployment with local image storage! üöÄ
